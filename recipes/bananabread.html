    <h3>Put those ripe bananas to use in moist, delicious banana bread.</h3>
    <p>
      This banana bread has been the most popular recipe on Simply Recipes for
      over 10 years. Thousands of people make it every day. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it really is the best banana bread recipe, period. You can mix
      everything in one bowl, you can vary the amount of sugar or bananas. And
      the secret to its great flavor? Melted butter.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4
        to 1 1/2 cups mashed)
      </li>
      <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>
        3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if
        more sweet)
      </li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C): Butter an 8x4-inch loaf pan.</li>
      <li>
        Mash the bananas and add the butter: In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe
        bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into
        the mashed bananas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in the remaining ingredients: Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir
        in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the bread: Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. - Bake for
        55 to 65 minutes at 350째F (175째C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer
        inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay;
        streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but
        the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue
        baking until the loaf is fully baked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool and serve: Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few
        minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool
        completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make
        slices that aren't crumbly.) Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at
        room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up
        to 5 days, or freeze it.
      </li>
    </ol>
