      As the weather warms up, cool down with a chilled glass of Strawberry
      Peach Smoothie. A mixture of ripe fruit, yogurt, and citrus juice makes
      for a quick breakfast or midday snack.

    <p>
      Ripe strawberries have a jammy flavor, thatâ€™s sweet with a hint of
      acidity. When paired with the slightly tart flavor of yellow peaches they
      are the perfect pairing.
