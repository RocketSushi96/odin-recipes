    <h1>Japanese Soufflé Pancakes</h1>

    <h3>
      Japanese soufflé pancakes are the holy grail of fluffy pancakes. They are
      cloud-like, airy, tall, and sweet. Your family will be so impressed!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Japanese soufflé pancakes are a hybrid of airy soufflés and flat, sweet
      American-style pancakes—they call for the same ingredients, like flour,
      eggs, sugar, milk, and baking powder, just much less of it. Copious
      amounts of billowy meringue, whipped egg whites stabilized with sugar and
      cream of tartar, are folded into the pancake batter, making them
      incredibly fluffy.

    <p>
      These impressive pancakes are a true labor of love. They take some
      practice to perfect and need to be cooked and served immediately. You can
      only cook two or three at a time as they need space in the pan to be
      flipped. Earmark these for when you have time for a leisurely brunch or
      want to impress someone.

    <h4>Japanese Soufflé Pancakes Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 egg yolks and 4 egg whites (4 large eggs total), cold straight out of
        the fridge
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup (33g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/16 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons whole milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon avocado or canola oil, plus more for the skillet</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (50g) sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Japanese Soufflé Pancakes Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the egg yolk mixture: Separate the 4 eggs—you’ll need 4 egg whites
        in a large bowl and 2 egg yolks in separate large bowl. Save the
        remaining 2 egg yolks for another use. Place the egg whites in the
        fridge to chill while you make the egg yolk batter. To the egg yolks,
        add the flour, baking powder, vanilla, salt, milk, and oil. Whisk until
        smooth and set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the skillet: Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over very,
        very, very low heat. My stove top goes from 0 to 10 and I set it to a 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the meringue: Take the egg whites out of the fridge and add the
        cream of tartar. Use a hand mixer to whisk them on medium-low speed for
        about 30 seconds. You can also use a stand mixer. Increase the speed to
        medium and whisk for 1 minute, gradually sprinkling in the sugar. Then,
        increase the speed to medium-high and whisk until the egg whites are
        glossy, billowy, and form firm peaks. From start to finish, it should
        take about 5 minutes. The meringue is ready when you can invert the bowl
        and it will not fall out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the batter: Scrape about 1/2 cup of the meringue into the yolk
        mixture and gently whisk to combine. This will make it easier to
        incorporate the remaining meringue into the batter. Add about half of
        the remaining meringue and use a spatula to gently fold it in until
        mostly combined—you will still see streaks of white. Fold in the
        remaining meringue. Be gentle and make sure not to overmix. You want the
        batter to stay light and airy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the pancakes: Use the pastry brush to lightly brush oil on the
        skillet. Use a large spoon to scoop 3 evenly sized pancakes, about 3
        generous tablespoons each, with the batter piled up high. Do not spread
        the batter out with the spoon. Immediately drizzle about 1 tablespoon of
        water on an empty space inside the skillet, trying not to let the water
        touch the pancakes. This will create steam to help the pancakes stay
        moist. If the water sizzles and evaporates right away, your skillet is
        too hot—lower it even more. Immediately cover the skillet with a lid and
        let the pancakes cook for 10 minutes. The exact cook time depends on how
        much heat the lowest setting on your stovetop emits. It should cook very
        low and slow. Try not to lift the lid to peak as the pancakes cook. Keep
        the remaining batter refrigerated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the pancakes: After 10 minutes, scoop 1 tablespoon of batter on top
        of each pancake. Run an offset spatula or a very thin spatula under a
        pancake—it’s best to use the long side of the offset spatula, not the
        tip. The pancake will release from the skillet easily when it’s ready.
        Don’t force it! If it starts to fall apart, let it cook for 2 to 5 more
        minutes with the lid on, but do not increase the heat. Carefully flip
        all 3 pancakes. The bottoms, now on top, will be a deep golden brown.
        Cover the skillet and cook for about 8 minutes. When the pancakes are
        ready, it will be easy to release them from the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the pancakes: Serve the pancakes right away—leftovers aren’t
        great. The pancakes may deflate a little, but that’s okay! Follow the
        same methods to cook the remaining pancakes.
